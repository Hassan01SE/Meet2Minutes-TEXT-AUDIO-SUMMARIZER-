The Automated Meeting Summarizer project is a cutting-edge solution that harnesses 
the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to provide automated summary features for text, 
audio, and video recordings of meetings. The project aims to revolutionize the way 
organizations and individuals manage and organize their meetings by providing a 
simple and efficient way to summarize important information and make it easily 
accessible to all participants. With the increasing use of technology in meetings, there is 
a growing need for a system that can effectively capture and analyze the vast amount of 
data generated during meetings. The Automated Meeting Summarizer project 
addresses this need by utilizing advanced AI algorithms to analyze the data and identify 
key points and important information.
The project is designed to work with a wide range of data sources including meeting 
transcripts, audio recordings, and video recordings. 
The AI-based technology used in this project is 
capable of analyzing large amounts of data and 
identifying key points and important information. The 
system is also able to extract key insights and trends 
from the data, making it an invaluable tool for 
decision-making and strategic planning. The 
Automated Meeting Summarizer project is also 
designed to be user-friendly, making it easy for 
individuals and organizations to access and utilize the 
information generated by the system.
